Recursion Problems Assignment 1

This repository contains Java methods for solving various algorithmic problems. Each problem is implemented as a separate method in the Main class.

List of Problems

Problem 1: Method to find the minimum element in an array
Problem 2: Method to find the average an array
Problem 3: Method to check if a number is prime
Problem 4: Method to calculate the factorial of a number
Problem 5: Method to find the Fibonacci n-th element
Problem 6: Function to calculate power of a number 
Problem 7: Method to reverse an array and measure the time taken
Problem 8: Method to check if a string consists only of digits and measure the time taken
Problem 9: Method to calculate the binomial coefficient of two numbers and measure the time taken
Problem 10: Method to calculate the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers and measure the time taken


Usage

To run any of the above problems, call the respective method from the Main class 
Each problem prompts the user for input and displays the result along with the time taken for execution
